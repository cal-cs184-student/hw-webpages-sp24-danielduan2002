<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>In this project, I implemented a rasterizer, a program 
	that takes abstract representations of shapes and objects, and renders 
	them into an image using points, lines, and triangles as the underlying 
	primitives. This project explored many interesting concepts like supersampling, barycentric coordinate interpolation, 
	and texture mapping. Supersampling enabled the antialiasing of a rendered image, 
	smoothing out jagged edges and corners. Barycentric coordinate interpolation 
	allowed for smooth color gradients. Texture mapping techniques allowed for textures to
	be applied to a scene. 
	<br><br>
	This project was a big undertaking in conceptual understanding and programmatic effort. 
	I learned a lot about computer graphics fundamentals, and developing in C++ changed my opinion
	of the C programming language (I hated it in CS162). I felt like I spent a whole lifetime debugging, 
	but I learned the most when things were going wrong.

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h3>
<p> At a high level, the triangle rasterization procedure takes in coordinates to 
	a triangle's three corners as well as the desired rgb color of the triangle, 
	identifies the pixels on the screen that lie inside the triangle, and sets those pixels to the desired color. 
	My implementation of triangle rasterization consisted of these steps: 
	<br><br>
	1. Compute the bounding box that encloses the triangle. A naive approach would check every single (x,y) pixel in screen space. We can do 
	better by using this fact: any pixel that lies outside of a triangle's bounding box also 
	lies outside the triangle.
	<br>
	2. Iterate over each pixel inside the bounding box, perform three line tests to determine 
	if the pixel lies inside or outside of the triangle. Fill the pixel with the color if it lies
	inside the triangle. 
	<br><br>
	An example output of the triangle rasterization procedure is shown below. Aliasing is visible
	at the corners of some of the triangles, suggesting the procedure has room for improvement.

<h3 align="middle">Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h3>
<p> To tackle the issue of aliasing from Task 1, we leverage an approach called 
	supersampling. Supersampling subdivides each pixel for more precise subsamples, and
	results in a rasterization with high-frequency content filtered out. For the task 1 triangles, 
	supersampling will have the visual effect of "smoothing" out the jaggies in the triangles' edges and corners.
	<br><br>
	In the codebase, supersampling involved dynamically resizing the sample_buffer data structure 
	by the given supersampling rate. The triangle rasterization algorithm from Task 1
	was then modified to perform the inside triangle test for each subsample coordinate
	of every pixel. At the end of the pipeline, the rasterized sample_buffer data is resolved
	to the screen's framebuffer. With supersampling, resolving a pixel's final color involves
	computing the average color of each of it's subsamples from the sample_buffer.
	<br><br>
	Supersampling requires data structures with more memory, as well as modifications
	to the rasterization algorithm that result in a larger time complexity. The final product, however,
	is worth the cost. Antialiased triangles!!

<h3 align="middle">Task 3: Transforms</h3>
<p align="middle"> 
	This task added support for translation, scaling, and rotation operations on coordinate vectors.
	<br><br>
	I like spaghetti, so I added rotations to the svg to give the robot wavy spaghetti noodle arms and legs.

<h3 align="middle">Task 4: Barycentric Coordinates</h3>
<p> Barycentric coordinates are a coordinate system defined through 
	three values (alpha, beta, gamma) derived from a reference triangle. Given some vertex data for a 
	triangle, barycentric coordinates are useful for interpolating that data 
	across the triangle's surface. Using the triangle example below, a coordinate that is 
	closer to the red vertex would have a greater weight assigned to the color red. 
	Doing this for many triangles can create images like the circle on the right, with 
	a smooth gradient of many colors going around the circle.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel Sampling" for Texture Mapping</h3>
<p> Pixel sampling involves the task of identifying which pixel from a 
	texture should be sampled for a given pixel in screen space. 
	The map between the texturespace and the screenspace may be highly non-linear. 
	Different pixel sampling methods like nearest-neighbor and bilinear offer different 
	approaches picking a texture. 

  Nearest-neighbor pixel sampling simply identifies the nearest texel. 
  Bilinear sampling, in contrast, finds the four closest texels in the texture map
   and performs linear interpolations across the horizontal and vertical axes to  
  produce a color value that is averaged across the coordinate's surroundings.
  <br><br>
  <b>Figure 5a and b</b> illustrate differences between the two pixel sampling approaches. 
  Bilinear sampling produces a higher quality render of Sather Tower than nearest-neighbor sampling, 
  evident by the more natural shadows and edges produced by the bilinear sampling. 
  <br><br>
  In both sampling methods, supersampling improves the quality. 
  The largest differences between bilinear and nearest-neighbor are found at sample
   points where the area of the 
  screen space is bigger relative to the texture space. Under nearest-neighbor, this 
  results in one texel being applied to many screen samples. Bilinear sampling does better 
  in this instance.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
<p> Level sampling and mipmaps help to address issues related to minification. 
	Minification refers to the case where a single pixel in screen space spans multiple 
	texels in texture space. 
	To address this, we use a process called level sampling, which uses collections of downsampled 
  textures, called mipmaps. We retrieve texel values from 
  the appropriate mipmap level (based on degree of minification at the local area) for a given pixel in screen space. 
  <br><br>
  Mipmaps are worth the implementation cost because they only need 
  an additional 1/3 amount of memory. The figures below show that nearest neighbor sampling 
  and bilinear sampling both demonstrate improvements to quality when paired with 
  level sampling.
